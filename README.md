LedMatrix
==========
This is my fork of the [LedControl](https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl) library.

I completely redesigned that library, leaving only low-level logic.

Main purposes
-------------
To make the code useable.
To perform the refactoring and optimization.

It still under construction
--------
At the moment it is not finished yet. Soon there will be a final version.
Although the library is already usable.
I will add new functions to this library soon.
